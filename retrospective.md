# Retrospective


Starting off, I spent a lot of time planning the project, breaking the process down into seperable phases. I  made the project plan with the help of trello:

However, I forgot to look at it most of the time during the building phase. But I guess the planning process still had it's purpose in giving me a clearer concept of the individual stages of the process. Next time I might try to stick to a plan a little more faithfully.

Also: I drew flow chart to visualize the validation flow, however this flow chart is now obsolete since I ended up implementing another program logic.
